# TODO-App, never forget!

### User Introduce

TODO-App is a small, light and fast todolist application.
The use is simple:

1- Type your TODO
documenta
2- Save it with "enter"

And There you go ! Your new TODO is added to your list of other TODOs!

Several possibilities are then available to you:

-   By checking a TODO, it is considered completed (it is scratched and remains in the list).
-   By clicking on the arrow, you can check all the boxes at once!
-   You can sort the TODOs according to their completions or not.
-   Delete all completed TODOs via the "clear completed" button
-   You can obviously delete all the elements independently (this is your list after all ðŸ˜‰).

Don't worry, your list items will remain saved in your browser. 
So you can close the page, turn off your computer, walk your dog, do the dishes, and then come back. They will always be there.
